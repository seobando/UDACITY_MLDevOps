# Predict Customer Churn

- Project **Predict Customer Churn** of ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree Udacity

## Project Description

This project was about doing a ready to production using coding best practices and testing for data science approach, over the notebook "churn_notebook.ipynb".

## Files and data description

The are 4 files and 4 folders in this project:

1. data -> Is a folder with the dataset used for the current project 
2. images -> Is a folder with the results of the EDA (eda) and the model (results) saved as images
3. logs -> Is a folder with the logs of the testing applied
4. models -> Is a folder with the models generated for churn prediction
5. churn_library.py -> Is a file with the library and functions used for organized and cleaned the churn_notebook.ipynb
6. churn_notebook.ipynb -> Is a file with the notebook that needed to be organized and cleaned
7. churn_script_logging_and_tests.py -> Is a file with the testing process over the churh_library.py
8. constants.py -> Is a file with the constant variables used for the project
9. requirements.txt -> Is the file with the requirements to run the project files

## Running Files

To run the current project follow the next steps:

1. Download the folder
2. Unzip the folder if is compresed
3. Open a console
4. Go to the root where the folder is
5. Install the requirement using: python -m pip install -r requirements_py.txt
6. Run the churn_script_logging_and_tests.py to be sure that the churn_library is working using: ipython churn_script_logging_and_tests.py
7. Run the churn_library.py using: ipython churn_library.py
